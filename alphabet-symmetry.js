// Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

function solve(arr) {
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    arr[i].split("");
  }
}

console.log(solve(["abode", "ABc", "xyzD"])); // [4,3,1]
